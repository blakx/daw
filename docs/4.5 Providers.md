# Providers

The Daw application relies on some key feature like logging, caching and access restrictions.

The application could have implemented them internally without any possibility to change them other by forking the project or changing the application core code. But the flexibility offered by the modules showed another way to implement them.

Each core feature may be implemented by a *Provider*. A module has the possibility to create its own implementation of the Provider and publish it. It will be then up to the application administrator to choose for each feature which provider to use.

This allows highliy flexible way to enhance the core application without having to change any part of its code.


## Supported functionnalities

Current version of the application supports the following functionnalities:
 - **cache**: Manage data caching
 - **log**: Log events
 - **security**: Manage application authentication and access permissions

Each feature is defined using a Provider interface that any module can implement to create its own version of the feature provider. The application does provide default providers for each functionallity so that it can run by itself without the need of any other modules but its bundled core module.


### Cache provider

The cache provider does contains all necessary methods used to manage cached date.

    abstract class CacheProvider extends \Daw\Core\Provider\Provider {

        /**
        * Return TRUE if this provider serves the specified feature
        *
        * @param string $feature
        */
        public function isProviderFor($feature) {
            return $feature === 'cache';
        }

        public abstract function contains($key);
        public abstract function get($key);
        public abstract function add($key, $data);
        public abstract function remove($key, $data);
        public abstract function purge();
    }

The default application provider stores cached date into one unique file, configurable through the *conf/cache.yml* configuration file:

    file: /0xDATA/projects/Daw/var/myapp.cache


### Log provider

The log provider allows users to log event using different severity levels.

    abstract class LogProvider extends \Daw\Core\Provider\Provider {

        /**
         * Return TRUE if this provider serves the specified feature
         *
         * @param string $feature
         */
        public function isProviderFor($feature) {
            return $feature === 'log';
        }

        public abstract function log($message, $level = \Daw\Core\Provider\Log\Level::INFO);

        public function fatal($message) {
            $this->log($message, \Daw\Core\Provider\Log\Level::FATAL);
        }
        public function error($message) {
            $this->log($message, \Daw\Core\Provider\Log\Level::ERROR);
        }
        public function warn($message) {
            $this->log($message, \Daw\Core\Provider\Log\Level::WARN);
        }
        public function notice($message) {
            $this->log($message, \Daw\Core\Provider\Log\Level::NOTICE);
        }
        public function info($message) {
            $this->log($message, \Daw\Core\Provider\Log\Level::INFO);
        }
        public function debug($message) {
            $this->log($message, \Daw\Core\Provider\Log\Level::DEBUG);
        }
        public function trace($message) {
            $this->log($message, \Daw\Core\Provider\Log\Level::TRACE);
        }
    }

The default provider supports different storage solutions for saving logs, and also implement filtering to define for which classes and starting with which severity level it shall start storing logs.

Configuration is performed via *conf/log.yml* configuration file

    # Where to store logs
       errorlog: errorlog 3 /tmp/php.log
    # Levels used per namespace / class
    levels:
        "Daw\\Modules\\Core\\Module.help": FATAL errorlog
        "Daw\\Modules\\Core\\Module": NOTICE errorlog
        "Daw\\Core\\Core": DEBUG errorlog
        "Daw": TRACE errorlog

    # Default settings
    defaultLevel: TRACE
    defaultFacility: errorlog


### Security provider

Security provider has 2 goals: authenticate users and verify access permissions to modules and operations:

    namespace Daw\Core\Provider;
    abstract class SecurityProvider extends \Daw\Core\Provider\Provider {

        /**
        * Return TRUE if this provider serves the specified feature
        *
        * @param string $feature
        */
        public function isProviderFor($feature) {
            return $feature === 'security';
        }

        /**
         * Perform the authentication of the user
         * Return TRUE if authentication is successful
         *
Â²         * @param array $token
         */
        public abstract function authenticate($token);

        /**
         * Check if user has access to the specified operation
         *
         * @param string $module
         * @param string $object
         * @param string $operation
         */
        public abstract function hasAccess($module, $object, $operation);
    }

The default implementation supports both features, by defining User objects to manage application users with password and setting access rules through *conf/security.yml* configuration file:

    authentication:
      enable: true               # true|false
      blacklist: axel guest

    access:
      default: deny                    # allow|deny
      operations:
        core.help:
          allow: all
        "admin.*":
          default: deny
          allow: admin



### Create your own feature and provider

You can extend the application by adding your own feature if you think this can be usefule toother modules.

The *Provider* interface is very simple, you just need to implement the *isProviderFor* method to specify for which feature the provider is used for, and the method.

    abstract class Provider {

        /**
         * Return TRUE if this provider serves the specified feature
         *
         * @param string $feature
         */
        public abstract function isProviderFor($feature);
    }


It is recommended to create an interface to allow other modules to create their own providers in case they do not want to used your provider.


## Access to functionnalities

Not only the application may have access to the functionnalities. Modules may also use it very easily.

Each feature can be used by accessing the property of the Core application instance with the name of the feature:

  $this->core->cache // access to the Cache provider
  $this->core->log // access to the Log provider
  $this->core->cache // access to the Security provider



Choice of the provider is made via the *Daw.yml* file, using the **providers*
* property:

    providers:
      log: core
      security: core
      cache: apcCache


To give a concrete example:
> **cache** is a feature supported by the application. The *core* module, bundled with the application, provides a simple implementation of this feature through a *CacheProvider* class that uses simple files to store cached data.
> You could decide, for performance reasons, to switch from this simple implementation to a more efficient caching mechanism, like APC. The apc module does publish a Provider for the cache feature using this mechanism.
> The administrator can therefore, in the application Daw.yml

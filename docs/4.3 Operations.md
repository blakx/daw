# Operations

## Create a new operation

Like objects, module operations are created by :
 * Adding a file in the *operations/* module directory
 * Adding its definition in the *module.info* description file

An operation may be run against an object created by this module or any other module, or run solely against directory the module (like an *help* operation)

Whatever type of operation is used, the format of the operation file remains the same:

    <?php

    namespace Daw\Modules\<module directory>\operations;

    class <OperationName> extends \Daw\Core\Module\Operation {

        public function run($args = array()) {
        }
    }

Module operations shall comply with **SturdlyCase**.


### Simple module operation

If you wish to create an operation that is not associated to an object, like *HelloWorld* case, the file of your operation shall be created under *operations/Help.inc*.

The *module.info* file shall then be updated as following:

    operations:
        helloWorld:
            description: "Module HelloWorld common implementation"



### Module operation on an object

If you wish to create an operation against a specific object, the file of your operation shall be created under *operations/${Object}${Operation}.inc*. If we take the example of listing all credit card numbers managed by your module, the file to be created will be *operations/CreditCardList.inc*

The *module.info* file shall then be updated as following:

    CreditCard.List:
        object: CreditCard
        operation: List
        description: "List all credit cards stored in module"


## Pass arguments to your operations

Arguments can be defined for each operation throug the *args* property. Each argument shall be listed, and for each of them the following information shall/may be provided:
 - description (optional): the description of the argument
 - format (optional): the format expected for the argument. Example of formats supported are:
    - text: no validation
    - boolean: argument shall be true/false/1/0
    - date
    - ip
    - list(...)
    ...
 - validation (optional): additional validation checks to be performed by the application. See validation section for more details.
 - default (optional): value to be passed to the operation if user did not specify the argument while calling the operation
 - options (optional): used only by the HTTP service, this gives hint on how to build a selection component for selecting a value from a given list.
 - multi: true/false - defines if the argument accepts a list of values


    client.create:
        object: client
        operation: create
        description: "Create new client"
        args:
            name:
                description: "Client name"
                format: string
                validation: required
            enabled:
                description: "Enabled"
                format: boolean
                default: true
                validation: required
            description:
                description: "Client information"
                format: string
                hint: "If not set, all sites will be returned"
            services:
                description: "List of services purchased"
                format: list(string)
                multi: true
                validation:
                    - required
                    - \Daw\Modules\Nbsdb\Objects\Client::validateServices
                default:
                    - STANDARD
                options:
                    - STANDARD
                    - THCQ
                    - ZEND
            contacts:
                description: "List of contacts associated to the client"
                hint: 'Each line: type:email address, email address, ...'
                format: text
                validation:
                    - \Daw\Modules\Nbsdb\Objects\Client::validateContacts


### Validate arguments

The Operation class has a built-in *validate* method called just before the *run* method, to validate arguments passed to the operation.

    /**
     * Base validation method
     *
     * This validates all arguments based on the validation specified
     * in the operation description
     *
     * @param array $args
     * @throws OperationArgumentException
     */
    protected function validate($args) {


The validation can be performed by specifying for each argument the properties **format** and **validation**

#### Format validation

Format validation is handled by the **validateFormat** method of the *Operation* base class. You can find in this method the list of all supported formats.

If the format could not have been verified, an **OperationArgumentException** expection will be raised by the method.

Note that format may use nested syntax as following:

    format: list(date)

The argument expected will accept a a list of dates to be specified, and not only a single date.


#### Additional validation

In addition to the format, more complex validation checks can be requested through the usage of the **validation** argument property.

Take this example:

    args:
        clientId:
            description: "Client ID"
            format: number
            validation:
                - required
                - client:id
                - \Daw\Modules\Nbsdb\Objects\Client::validateServices


The *clientId* will be tested against 3 additional checks:
 - **keyword checks**: today only *required* is supported, verifies if the argument has been passed by the user and is not empty
 - **list options checks**: verify that the value passed is defined in an object. In this example, the value shall correspond to an ID of a valid client
 - **programatic checks**: You can implement your own checks and passed them using the syntax *\My\Module\Namespace\Class::myValidationMethod
    - The method shall exist in the given class specified by its namespace and name
    - The method shall be static
    - The method shall take one unique argument representing the value to test
    - The method shall return true or throw a ValdationException

    /**
     * Extra validation to be performed on object property: services
     */
    public static function validateServices($value) {
        $services = $value;
        if ($services instanceof UpdateList) {
            self::validateServices($services->added);
            self::validateServices($services->removed);
            self::validateServices($services->set);
            return;
        }

        if (in_array(self::SERVICE_STANDARD, $services) && count($services) > 1) {
            throw new ValidationException('STANDARD service cannot be used with any other service');
        }

        return true;
    }


#### Overriding default validation methods

If your operation requires some very complex validation, you can still override the existing *validate* method to add your custom validation before or after default validation.

    /**
     * Custom operation validation
     *
     * @param array $args
     * @throws ValidationException
     */
    protected function validate($args) {
        // Run default validation
        parent::validate($args);

        // My custom validation
        ...
    }


## Operation process

The entry point of your operation is the run method. You can implement the business logic the way you want here. It is however recommended to dispatch your business workflows in dedicated classes to be located in the *business* directory.

The output of the operation will then be passed to the application formatting process.

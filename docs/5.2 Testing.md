# Testing

To ensure code quality, Daw core and modules rely on the following components:
 - [PHPUnit]() for unit testings
 - [PHPMD - PHP Mess Detector](http://http://phpmd.org/) for detecting code violation
 - [PHP Depend](http://http://pdepend.org/) for building any kind of metrics
 - [PHPcpd]

## Unit Testing with PHPUnit

### Install PHPUnit

#### Using PEAR

Run following commands, make sure previously that you have [PEAR](http://pear.php.net/) installed.

    pear config-set auto_discover 1
    pear install pear.phpunit.de/PHPUnit


*phpunit* binary will then be available in your path and ready to run

#### Using Composer

You can use [composer](http://getcomposer.org) to automatically install composer as Daw provides in this root directry a composer.json where composer is defined as a required component

    "require": {
        "phpunit/phpunit": "3.7.*"
    },

So just run composer at the top of your Daw installation:

    $> composer install


## Run PHPUnit against Daw code

Daw includes default PHPUnit settings in *phpunit.xml.dist* file located at the top of your Daw directory. You therefore just need to run phpunit to run the full Daw test suite:

    $> phpunit

Note that the default configuration does not include test suites implemented for any extra module.

The results of the tests will be available in the **docs/tests** sub-directory.


## Run PHPUnit against your module code

Each module contains in its root directory a *phpunit.xml.dist* configuration file to easily run PHPUnit against your module. The configuration expects you to implement all your tests in the **tests** directory available at the base of your module repository.

To run the module test suite, go therefore to your module directory and run:

    $> phpunit

The results of the tests will be available in the **docs/tests** sub-directory


## Code Quality with PHPMD

### Install PHPMD

#### Using Composer

You can use [composer](http://getcomposer.org) to automatically install composer as Daw provides in this root directry a composer.json where PHPMD is defined as a required component

    "require": {
        "phpmd/phpmd": "1.4.0"
    },

So just run composer at the top of your Daw installation:

    $> composer install

### Run PHPMD against your code

To be filled...


## Code Metric with PHP Depend

### Install PHP Depend

#### Using Composer

You can use [composer](http://getcomposer.org) to automatically install composer as Daw provides in this root directry a composer.json where PHP Depend is defined as a required component

    "require": {
        "pdepend/pdepend": "1.1.0"
    },

So just run composer at the top of your Daw installation:

    $> composer install

### Run PHPMD against your code

    phpmd ../modules/ text design,naming,codesize,unusedcode,controversial

    phpmd core/ html design,naming,codesize,unusedcode,controversial > tests/phpmd.core.html
    phpmd modules/ html design,naming,codesize,unusedcode,controversial > tests/phpmd.modules.html



## Code duplication check

### Install using PEAR

    sudo pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
    sudo pear channel-discover components.ez.no
    sudo pear upgrade pear

    sudo pear install phpunit/phpcpd

### Run phpcdp

    phpcpd --progress --names "*.php,*.inc" *


## Future enhancements

To enhance control quality of the project and its modules and also provide a fully integrated build platform for all 3rd-party code, the following projects are being under evaluation:
 - [Sonar](http://www.sonarsource.org/) as code quality management platform for all Daw projects
 - Jenkins as continuous integration platform
 - More from [The PHP Quality Assurance Toolchain](http://phpqatools.org/)

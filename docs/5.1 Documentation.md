# Documentation

Daw uses [phpDocumentor](http://phpdoc.org/) for generating API reference.

## Installing PhpDocumentor

### Using PEAR

Run following commands, make sure previously that you have [PEAR](http://pear.php.net/) installed.

    pear channel-discover pear.phpdoc.org
    pear install phpdoc/phpDocumentor-alpha

*phpdoc* binary will then be available in your path and ready to run

## Generate Daw documentation

At the root of the project, run the following:

    $> phpdoc

The documentation will be at this point available for consultation in your browser in the **docs/references** directory.

### Tweaking doc generation

phpDocumentor uses file *phpdoc.dist.xml* for configuring the documentation generation. By default, the application is configured to generate documentation for everything under *src* directory.


## Generate module documentation

Each module may have its own documentation generated automatically by phpdoc, providing that you use the proper tags recognized by [PHPDoc](http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/for-users/phpdoc/tag-reference.html).

You may then want to specify a phpdoc.dist.xml file at the root of your module repository, to provide to phpDocumentor instructions on how to handle your source code. An example of such file is available in the skeleton module provided in Daw build.

Once done, you just need to build your module documentation by running at the root of your module:

    $> phpdoc

Unless you have updated the phpdoc.dist.xml file, the module code reference will be available in module's **docs/references** directory

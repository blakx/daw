# Daw Internals

Daw can be seen as a module manager, where each module is responsible to provide access to one or more application and their respective data.

Daw introduces very simple notions to help users implement new modules:
 - **objects** for wrapping application data in various structured objects
 - **operations** to perform an action, potentially on objects. Operations correspond to the services published to users.
 - **formatters** to transform operation response and objects into human-readable contents using different frmats
 - **providers** to implement application internal functionnality that can be used transparently by all modules


The goal also of Daw is to allow modules to share their knowledge while allowing great flexibility.

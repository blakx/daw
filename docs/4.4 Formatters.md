# FORMATTERS

A formatter is a class responsible to translate a data returned by module into a specific format.

Each operation may return data:
 - expected results returned as output of the *run* method
 - an exception if any error occured while processing the operation.

The application will take any of this output and will try to translate


## Supported formats

Currently the following formats are supported:
 * JSON
 * TextIdent

Depending on the service used, the format used will vary:
 - CLI service uses TextIdent format
 - API service uses JSON format
 - HTTP service may use any of them


## How formatting works

The principle is pretty simple:
- Each formatter registered with the application is able to say if it can handle a specific object based on its class and the format requested.
- The application will therefore go over each registered formatter till it finds a formatter accepting to process the object.
- If the object is of a complex type (array, class, etc...), a formatter may ask for any of the object property to call another formatter. The process can be recursive to ensure flexibility and reuse of forrmatters specialized for exampe for some object tyes.

Note that the application does register by itself some default formatters to ensure at minimum a proper output:
 - JsonFormatter: format anything in JSON
 - TextIndentFOrmatter: format anything in TextIndent
 - ExceptionFormatter: format any Exception object
 - ServiceResponseFormatter: format any ServicResponse objects
 - WebServiceResponseFormatter: format ServicResponse objects return by HTTP or API service
 - ModuleFormatter: format Module objects
 - OperationFormatter: format Operation objects



## The Formatter class

    namespace DawCoreFormatter;

    /**
     * Application Formatter abstract base class
     *
     * To create your own formatter, extend this class and define
     * which objects this formatter shall render by setting the
     * isFormatterFor method.
     *
     * @package Daw
     * @subpackage Formatters
     */
    abstract class Formatter {

        protected $core = null;
        protected $context = null;


        /**
         * Return true if formatter supports given object and possibly given format
         *
         * @param object $object object to render
         * @param DawCoreFormatter\Format $format format to be used for rendering
         * @return boolean
         */
        public abstract function isFormatterFor($object, $format = null);

        /**
         * Render object passed as first argument.
         *
         * Format to be used for renderring the object is passed as second argument
         * in case the formatter supports multiple formats
         *
         * @param object $object object to render
         * @param DawCoreFormatter\Format $format format to be used for rendering
         * @return
         */
        public abstract function render($object, $format);
    }

The 2 main methods are:
  - **isFormatterFor**: this is the method the application will call to know if the formatter is able to format the passed object with the specified format. The formatter shall return true to accept the formatting of the object, otherwise the application will go to the next formatter
  - **render**: the actual formatting method


## Create your own formatter

Creating your own formatter is very simple:
 - Create your formatter class which must extends the Formatter base class, and save the associated file in the *formatters* directory.
 - Add the name of your formatter in your *module.info* file:

    formatters:
        - MyObjectFormatter


The application will then take into account this new formatter, providing that you have enabled your module in the application.


## To be done

 - Add a priority level to each formatter to prioritze usage of formatters for the same object and format
 - Allow an operation to override formatter selection

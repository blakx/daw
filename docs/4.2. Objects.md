# Objects

An object represents a type of data to be accessible from an application.

## Create a new object

Creating a new object published by the module is as easy as:
 * Adding a file in the *objects/* module directory
 * Adding its definition in the *module.info* description file

If you want your module to create a new **CreditCard** object, add a file *objects/CreditCard.inc* with following contents:

    <?php

    namespace Daw\Modules\<my module directory>\objects;

    class CreditCard extends \Daw\Core\Object\Object  {
        protected $id;
        protected $name;
        protected $number;
        protected $expirationDate;

        public function primaryKey() {
            return 'id';
        }
    }

All protected properties will be considered as the object properties to be published.


The **\Daw\Core\Object\Object** implements very few methods, just the required one to access its properties:

    namespace Daw\Core\Object;

    abstract class Object {

        private $info = array();

        public function __construct($info = array()) {
            $this->info = $info;
        }

        public abstract function primaryKey();

        /**
         * Return module information
         */
        public function info($value = null) {
            if ($value === null) {
                return $this->info;
            }

            return $this->info[$value];
        }

        public function __get($key) {
            if (isset($this->info[$key])) {
                return $this->info[$key];
            }
            return null;
        }

        public function __set($key, $value) {
            $this->info[$key] = $value;
            return $this;
        }

        public function clear() {
            $this->info = array();
        }
    }

You can then implement all the methods that you want for managing your objects.



### Object description in module.info

In order to publish a new object, the module shall include it in its *module.info* in the **objects** setting, using the object Name as key and providing a description of the object and the list of all properties to be made public to users.

    objects:
      CreditCard:
        description: "Credit Card simple implementation"
        properties:
            id: 'Unique ID'
            name: 'Client name'
            number: 'number'
            expirationDate: 'ExpirationDate'


## Use objects in operations

The *module.info* file shall then be updated as following:

    CreditCard.List:
        object: CreditCard
        operation: List
        description: "List all credit cards stored in module"


Providing such information will be useful when using operations like **operations.list** or **object.info** in order to know right away what operations are available for a given object.


## Object stores

A store is a class abstracting the access of objects using a specific storage. You can have database stores, file stores, ...

The goal of the store is to provide a class to perform all your CRUD operations on your objects transparently, without having to implement the storage facilities each time. The secondary goal is to facilitate the migration from one storage to another, by simply changing the object store to use. As each object store has to implement a unique interface publishing all possible CRUD operations, moving to one storage to another will not required any code change, you just need to focus on how to migrate your data.

### ObjectStore Interface

    <?php

    abstract class ObjectStore {

        // CRUD operations

        public abstract function create($object);
        public abstract function read($id);
        public abstract function update($object);
        public abstract function save($object);
        public abstract function delete($object);

        // Additional operations

        public abstract function search($params = null);
        public abstract function exists($object);
    }


### Existing Implementations

#### FileStore

A file store is instanciated by specifying in which file the objects shall be stored, and the class of the objects to manage.
All objects of the same type will be stored in one unique file specified in the constructor.

    /**
     * ObjectStore eligible to store records in a file
     */
    abstract class FileStore extends ObjectStore {

        protected $filepath = null;
        protected $store = null;
        protected $class = null;


        /**
         * Constructor
         */
        protected function __construct($file, $class) {
            $this->filepath = Core::instance()->path($file);
            $this->class = $class;
            parent::__construct();
        }
